        "Sprouted was founded with the intention to provide premium quality Edible Oils and help farmers live a dignified life by paying them what they deserve. We purchase Organic Wood Cold Pressed Edible Oils directly from farmers across India at a fair price which are processed with the Wood Cold Pressed method/ Kachi Ghani/ Kohlu. This method for extracting the Oil is way better than other refined oils used for day to day consumption. Sprouted Founders always prioritize the health of their customers by working on providing the best natural Kachi Ghani Oils and A2 Cow Desi Ghee. Sprouted A2 Cow Desi Ghee is pure, natural which is churned by women farmers with their hands bi-directionally in a wooden churner. We want to empower and support women farmers without any age limit who are trying to become successful entrepreneurs With a history of adulterated products in the market, Sprouted Founders came up with an idea to provide premium quality products in the market sourced from different parts of the country. Our Founders Manupreet Singh and Amit Kaur are Delhiites and worked in corporate jobs for a decade and 6 yrs respectively. Manupreet Singh has expertise in legal and finance background whereas Amit Kaur has expertise in Marketing, Information Technology and Human Resources. Sprouted Founders did a lot of research before they came across organic Oils in which (i) nuts are grown without the use of toxic pesticides, (ii) Oil is not filtered through chemicals and (iii) Chemicals are not used to increase shelf life or production capacity. Founders found that most brands use the above mentioned ways to increase the production capacity and shelf life of the product or even add aroma or flavor. Sprouted Founders also understood that 1 Litre of premium quality Wood Cold pressed Oil takes 4 Kgs (Approx) of Nuts. We provide Oils in which nutrition is maintained in the Oil whereas in Refined Oils the nutrition goes away due to the heat generated while processing the Oil. Our goal is to provide chemical free, preservative free, completely natural products with no adulteration. Why Sprouted Dealership ? (A) Tested Unique Business model (B) Excellent margin (C) Standard Operating Procedures in all aspects of business (D) Leads Support By Brand (E) Regular Research and development BENEFITS OF THE BRAND DISTRIBUTER :- 1.

        "Welcome To Advance Naturopathy We have been running Naturopathy Centre in Mumbai since last 4 years, during which the centre has treated many patients from cold to cancer successfully. We have used many naturopathy therapy & supplements like Apple cider vinegar, wheat grass, Energies Mineral drops, flower remedies, cow colostrum, curcumin extracts & many more. We have found that this few herbs can do a lot of miracle in various diseases, we have got the best results but the limitations were that we can’t provide treatment for patients who are far .distance. So we decided to make available for you all across India. FIRST TIME IN INDIA VINEGAR THERAPY. In 2008 when practicing Naturopathy I came across Apple cider vinegar and Honey Recipie for health. As we believe in Naturopathy majority of illness is caused by Acid – Alkaline Imbalance in the body. Apple cider vinegar surely maintains it. First miracle I found in for indigestion. Next I gave to a patient who had been diagnosed for stomach ulcer and was going too operated in couple of weeks. She got relief in 15 days. I have successfully used on more than 80 patients for dissolving kidney stone. The dosage is different for kidney stone which I have formulated.(See the formula chart). When I used it for patients with multiple heart blockages & the results were astonishing, then I decided to market ACV aggressively in India. I made different types of vinegar like Turmeric (first time in world), Coconut, Ginger, Garlic, and Black Grapes & Aloe vera for Specific types of type of illness which gave me fast results. THE CONCEPT OF NATUROPATHY In naturopathy we believe that Acid- Alkaline imbalance in our body is the root cause of every disease i.e. Body PH. Apple Cider Vinegar helps to maintain body PH levels so we can easily prevent or get rid of diseases. The term pH stands for potential hydrogen. It is the degree of concentration of hydrogen ions in a substance such as water, blood and food. pH is measured on a scale from 0 to 14. The lower the pH reading - the more acidic a substance is. The higher the pH reading, the more alkaline the body is. A pH of 7 is neutral. Ph balance is the balance of acid and alkaline in all fluids and cells throughout your body. Our bodies are alkaline by design and acid by function.

The Montessori Method is an educational approach with a structured curriculum which revolves around each individual child’s learning style, strengths, interests, and learning pace. Multi sensory materials guide the curious minds of children helping them understand the world around them. Montessori is a unique approach centering on the sensitive period of learning between the age of 3 years to 6 years when children absorb easily in an enriching environment. Each step in this approach leads to the next level and repetition is an integral part of this learning. The Montessori foundation makes children active learners and creative thinkers as they learn to study independently without much help from adults. T&C Apply Team Franchise Apply",

        "India's First Veda's Inspired Preschool Chain Established in the year 2013, Bella Mente's core belief is to completely transform the paradigms of parenting in an ever-shifting world of rapid digitization. In this era of gadget indulgence, our ideology is an inward journey, a return to the roots. We aim to be a pillar of stability and growth to children in their developmental years while establishing a strong relationship parents can look forward to. Bella Mente is a home where children make fond memories for life, a celebration of childhood and the birth of beautiful minds. Competent Child Every child is valued as a novel individual with their own unique identity, strength, and talent. Their core potential influences ways of learning, adapting, and grasping knowledge. These talented youngsters must be nurtured as capable learners for a bright future. We specialize in constructive learning methods for children to help increase their domain of knowledge with practical experiences. This is accomplished through using a child’s endless imagination and innate sense of curiosity. This new model of learning not only benefits the overall development of a child, but also contributes to making opportunities for them through creative lessons. Competent Teacher Educators at Bella Mente are trained by mentors to gain expertise in understanding a child’s psychological state, learning capabilities, behavioural patterns, and social nature. They are equipped with the capacity to explore a child’s potential and attain perfection in addressing youngsters. Competent Parents Parents are an integral part of a child’s learning process, holding the responsibility to lay a robust foundation for their growth. Being the child’s initial teacher, parents are aware of their son or daughter’s psychological needs and can help mould them for better development. They have unique knowledge of their children which serves as a tremendous resource in supporting development and growth. At Bella Mente, the significant contribution of parents is duly recognized in liaison with quality learning. Vision We dream of developing a community that respects children as self-learners. We envision a future where our students reach their full potential as accomplished visionaries. As the second stepping stone into the world, we aim to make this journey unforgettable till posterity. Mission We aim to revolutionize the early childhood education system by leading a unique philosophy that combines Vedic learning with the Reggio-Emilia approach.In this age suffering from a paradox of choice, Bella Mente aims to impart lifelong values to children, building a robust foundation for their future.

        "India's First Veda's Inspired Preschool Chain Established in the year 2013, Bella Mente's core belief is to completely transform the paradigms of parenting in an ever-shifting world of rapid digitization. In this era of gadget indulgence, our ideology is an inward journey, a return to the roots. We aim to be a pillar of stability and growth to children in their developmental years while establishing a strong relationship parents can look forward to. Bella Mente is a home where children make fond memories for life, a celebration of childhood and the birth of beautiful minds. Competent Child Every child is valued as a novel individual with their own unique identity, strength, and talent. Their core potential influences ways of learning, adapting, and grasping knowledge. These talented youngsters must be nurtured as capable learners for a bright future. We specialize in constructive learning methods for children to help increase their domain of knowledge with practical experiences. This is accomplished through using a child’s endless imagination and innate sense of curiosity. This new model of learning not only benefits the overall development of a child, but also contributes to making opportunities for them through creative lessons. Competent Teacher Educators at Bella Mente are trained by mentors to gain expertise in understanding a child’s psychological state, learning capabilities, behavioural patterns, and social nature. They are equipped with the capacity to explore a child’s potential and attain perfection in addressing youngsters. Competent Parents Parents are an integral part of a child’s learning process, holding the responsibility to lay a robust foundation for their growth. Being the child’s initial teacher, parents are aware of their son or daughter’s psychological needs and can help mould them for better development. They have unique knowledge of their children which serves as a tremendous resource in supporting development and growth. At Bella Mente, the significant contribution of parents is duly recognized in liaison with quality learning. Vision We dream of developing a community that respects children as self-learners. We envision a future where our students reach their full potential as accomplished visionaries. As the second stepping stone into the world, we aim to make this journey unforgettable till posterity. Mission We aim to revolutionize the early childhood education system by leading a unique philosophy that combines Vedic learning with the Reggio-Emilia approach.In this age suffering from a paradox of choice, Bella Mente aims to impart lifelong values to children, building a robust foundation for their future.

DMIT Test is entirely based on the science of Dermatoglyphics and the concept of Multiple Intelligence introduced by Dr. Howard Gardner. To understand how DMIT works, you need to first understand the human brain which is divided into 5 lobes: frontal, prefrontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital. Each of these lobes is further divided into 2 parts as per brain division in right and left brain. This makes a total of 10 parts, each of which is responsible for a different function. Another interesting thing is brain formation and fingerprint formation is synchronized with the fetus in the mother’s body in the first 13 to 19 weeks. The 10 parts in the human brain are associated with 10 fingers. Interestingly, fingertips can be used to identify the strength and weaknesses of brain structures. It helps you understand the part of the brain that is the intelligence area. If the fingerprint analysis report generated is correct, the DMIT test can give you results with up to 90% accuracy.

UCMAS has been recognized worldwide for its proven results – with the most obvious being the learners’ fantastic mental arithmetic ability and speedy calculation after undergoing the mental arithmetic program. Mental arithmetic compromises arithmetic calculation regardless of the complexity, utilizing only the brain. What initially seems impossible becomes a reality with UCMAS! What is UCMAS? The word UCMAS leaves a sense of curiosity in everybody’s mind all the time. People always want to know what UCMAS is and why the world is talking about UCMAS. UCMAS is a unique and scientifically-proven mental development program designed for children to develop their latent mental power at a very early age when brain development is reaching its peak.? It is the UC International Corporation’s pioneer program and has enjoyed the most success to date. Along with innovative syllabus and modern educational techniques, whereby junior learners practice with an age-old tool (the abacus), the learning process not only stimulates the brain but also trains their ability to independently perform mental calculations in their head. UCMAS has been recognized worldwide for its proven results – with the most obvious being the learners’ fantastic mental arithmetic ability and speedy calculation after undergoing the mental arithmetic program. Mental arithmetic compromises arithmetic calculation regardless of the complexity, using only the brain. What initially seems impossible becomes a reality with UCMAS! It is more than Maths! On the surface, it can be assumed that arithmetic is the primary focus of this program, and the end goal is to be able to perform outstanding feats of calculation using solely the mind.  However, this program strives to develop other mental abilities as well like concentration, observation, listening, imagination & visualization, as well as memory. The incredible calculation speed and accuracy you can achieve is only because all these other areas of the brain have been developed as well! Learners equipped with our brain-enhancing skills will also with no doubt find that they have increased self-confidence and independence in their academics. Team UCMAS",

        "ABOUT US What’ A Sandwich is a brand selling Submarine Sandwiches and Salads with a Desi Touch. The brand started in 2013 is now spread across Delhi, Mumbai, Pune & Kolkata with over 150 + stores. When we started our first store when entering the market, there was a realisation that the market is flooded with Burgers and Pizzas and Rolls and Chinese, but no one is doing Submarine Sandwich or simply Subs. By entering a market which had just one player we rectified a gap in the market by making out product “Bigger” and more “Affordable” and that’s how we captured our share in the market. We have modeled ourselves as “Delivery Kitchen” restaurant only to save on high rental costs and operate on volumes. Get 5 Brands in the price of One Investment! 1. Submarine Sandwiches & Salads 2. Italian Premium Panini Sandwiches 3. Indo-Western Pav based Burgers 4. French Fries Dishes 5. Healthy Salad Brand Why Franchise With What’ A Sandwich ? (A) Tested Unique Business model.

        'About us Mr. Gurpreet Singh and Mr. Arvinder Singh are the visionary founders of "Veerji Malai Chaap Wale." They pioneered the concept of integrating chaap into vegetarian cuisine, recognizing the desire of many people for the flavors of non-vegetarian food while staying true to a vegetarian diet. With this insight, they decided to create a unique vegetarian menu that replicates the taste of non-vegetarian dishes. In their quest to make vegetarian food as flavorful and appealing as its non-vegetarian counterparts, they introduced innovative names for their dishes, such as “Veg Chicken,” “Veg Mutton,” “Veg Fish,” “Veg Biryani,” “Sunny Leone Chaap,” “Mia Khalifa Chaap,” and many others. These creative names were designed to capture customers\' curiosity and interest. Their mission has always been to provide the rich and savory experience of non-vegetarian cuisine using only vegetarian ingredients. Since the opening of their first outlet in 2012 in Geeta Colony, followed by Laxmi Nagar in Delhi, and several other locations across India, their brand has grown immensely. The demand for their delicious, vegetarian dishes that mimic the taste of non-vegetarian food continues to rise across the country. The journey began with a focus on pure soya, and they have since expanded their offerings while staying true to the core of their concept: delivering mouthwatering vegetarian food that satisfies the cravings of even the most ardent non-veg lovers.

        'About us Mr. Gurpreet Singh and Mr. Arvinder Singh are the visionary founders of "Veerji Malai Chaap Wale." They pioneered the concept of integrating chaap into vegetarian cuisine, recognizing the desire of many people for the flavors of non-vegetarian food while staying true to a vegetarian diet. With this insight, they decided to create a unique vegetarian menu that replicates the taste of non-vegetarian dishes. In their quest to make vegetarian food as flavorful and appealing as its non-vegetarian counterparts, they introduced innovative names for their dishes, such as “Veg Chicken,” “Veg Mutton,” “Veg Fish,” “Veg Biryani,” “Sunny Leone Chaap,” “Mia Khalifa Chaap,” and many others. These creative names were designed to capture customers\' curiosity and interest. Their mission has always been to provide the rich and savory experience of non-vegetarian cuisine using only vegetarian ingredients. Since the opening of their first outlet in 2012 in Geeta Colony, followed by Laxmi Nagar in Delhi, and several other locations across India, their brand has grown immensely. The demand for their delicious, vegetarian dishes that mimic the taste of non-vegetarian food continues to rise across the country. The journey began with a focus on pure soya, and they have since expanded their offerings while staying true to the core of their concept: delivering mouthwatering vegetarian food that satisfies the cravings of even the most ardent non-veg lovers.

Becoming a successful franchisee with Laziz Pizza isn't as daunting as it might seem. Naturally, there will be challenges but the basic requirements you need to overcome them and make your franchise work are assets you probably already possess.

More specifically, we believe that to succeed in the franchise business one needs to have the 3 Cs - Capital, Commitment, and Competence. And the same applies to you as an aspiring franchisee. Capital is a key ingredient to roll  out enough stores to create a brand presence in the market. Also, with more stores comes more economies of scale and a wider customer reach. All this helps build the brand while the location risks are diversified over a larger portfolio. Without the proper capital momentum may be lost, and the entire business may be put at risk . The Commitment to succeed is another vital ingredient. Food and beverage service is a business that requires managerial attention, a mid-term to long-term horizon, and a daily focus on details to make sure customers are satisfied consistently Competence It is difficult to execute even the best systems without having a capable team. That is why Laziz Pizza guarantees its systems and its training curriculum to develop good trained staff for the franchisee. Following the systems is the most reliable formula for ensuring a high level of customer satisfaction and repeat business. It needs to be remembered that each franchisee is responsible for building their own team as well as an infrastructure for implementation of their business on the ground. However, equally, you will receive continuous support from Laziz Pizza India. If you are still wondering whether you qualify, you might like to know that Laziz Pizza does not require a franchisee to have any direct previous experience in the food & beverage industry. Above all, we look for evidence that each partner has the 3 Cs it takes to succeed. If so, you are already on your way. WHY TO TAKE LAZIZ PIZZA FRANCHISE?

It is the house of India's first branded golgappa known as GapagapTM and its signature product. Golgappa (also known as panipuri, pani batasha, puchka, pakori, gupchup etc. in different parts of India) is one of the most favorite street snack in the country. These crispy small puris (Indian fried bread) are filled with a mixture of potatoes and spices and tangy spicy water of various flavors that is supposed to be put into the mouth in one go. Though favorite across India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangaladesh (entire Indian sub-continent), it is often frowned upon for the lack of hygiene with which it is often served. Therefore, though popular, and full of medicinal values for the variety of herbs and spices used, it is not considered as a healthy eating option by many. Same is with a variety of other savory snacks that are served across the country by road side hawkers. Chatar Patar decided to change that by pioneering to serve these hawkers style street food as an organized business. Prepared and served in hygienic conditions, with a variety of exotic choices of flavors, “Gapagap” and the other items on the menu have been highly appreciated both by Chatar Patar's guests as well as press.

        "About OJ ORGANICS We Offer The Best Organic Products The inception of OJ was in response to the global challenges posed by the second pandemic. With over eight years of experience and extensive knowledge in Ayurveda, I sought to make a meaningful contribution to overcoming this worldwide crisis. At that time, despair and disease seemed to have no clear solutions. However, drawing from Ayurvedic wisdom, which has addressed massive epidemics over the last 5,000 years, My journey started. NATURES IMMUNITY GIFT my tag line of OJ specifies the harnessing of nature’s power for the benefit of mankind and it signifies my mission. My goal was to develop natural formulations devoid of any chemical ingredients that could help humanity combat pandemic diseases effectively without adverse side or after effects. This endeavor led to the establishment of OJ Organics, driven by the core principle of promoting health through nature’s remedies. As I progressed, it became evident that Ayurveda offers solutions for various aspects of human well-being, encompassing immunity, beauty, body care, and more. Today, we take pride in manufacturing over 100 products that span all five facets of Ayurveda. Our state-of-the-art facility, situated in the Bagru industrial area of Jaipur, employs automated processes to ensure precision and quality. We are committed to delivering 100% organic, natural products and guarantee the efficacy of our entire product range. Our mission extends beyond borders, aiming to make high-quality products accessible worldwide through the extensive OJ distribution network. In summary, OJ Organics was born from a desire to combat various deficiencies / ailments and diseases using natural Ayurvedic formulations, free from harmful chemicals. Our journey has evolved to encompass diverse aspects of human health, and we are dedicated to providing the world ,the benefits of Ayurveda and our slogan “WHAT WE PROMISE, OUR PRODUCTS DELIVER ” signifies this.
